The basis for the instrumental project came into being while Ford was still writing with Seattle luminaries Roadside Monument. Pulling towards a bass guitar-oriented sound, the songs he had begun to craft did not fully feel right for Roadside Monument, thus the forming of Unwed Sailor. \n\nThroughout the past 20 years, Unwed Sailor has performed with the likes of Pedro the Lion, Mary Timony, Low, The Danielson Famile, Sufjan Stevens, Minus the Bear, Battles, Mates of State, and Beach House. The band has since been relocated and based out of cities across the United States, including Chicago, Seattle, Washington D.C., Lawrence, KS, New Orleans LA and most recently Tulsa, OK. With numerous tours in the U.S. and Europe, the band has traveled almost as much as it has evolved.\n\nFrom their 1998 debut ep release, Firecracker(featuring Dave Bazan from Pedro the Lion, and Casey Wescott from Fleet Foxes) to their 2001 full length release The Faithful Anchor, the band strived to create studies into the pictures behind sound, while opening multiple avenues in the creation of reflective instrumental music. In 2002, these studies produced two short film soundtracks for independent film maker Chris Bennett - Stateless (a musical collaboration with Early Day Miners), and For Jonathan, a multi-genre compilation featuring artists The Album Leaf and Jessica Bailiff.\n\nIn 2003, the shape of Unwed Sailor changed dramatically as the sound became less a standard suite of instrumental rock songs, developing instead into a full scale storybook tale presented through classical baroque and nursery rhyme melodies, overlayed with organic/toy like percussion. The resulting album was recorded and released as The Marionette and the Music Box; music set to tell the painted \"story-book\" story of a lonely little marionette in search of a cherished, lost music box. With this change in musical direction, Unwed Sailor composed pieces just as suited for concert halls as they were the hot, impassioned stages of dark night clubs.\n\nIn 2006 the band introduced two brand new recordings with Dan Burton(Early Day Miners) once again behind the soundboard, the ambient/Eno-esque EP \"Circles\", and the atmospheric and brooding full length \"The White Ox\". These two releases ushered Unwed Sailor's sound into a dark, minimalistic world of Native American imagery, and soothing meditative moods.\nThese releases were supported by national tours with Me Without You, Murder By Death, and The Appleseed Cast, as well as an extensive 5 week tour throughout Europe.\n\nIn 2008, Unwed Sailor combined its instrumental rock roots, with the experimental/ambient sounds from its recent previous releases to create Little Wars. Little Wars features energetic and highly melodic instrumental rock songs, gently colored with layered synth keyboards and percussion. The album moves along steadily with danceable rhythms, melodic distortion, and delicate ambience.\n\nIn 2018, Unwed Sailor recorded Heavy Age. Recorded in Louisville KY, with the band currently based in both Tulsa, Oklahoma and Birmingham, Alabama, it too displays an image different from its predecessors—its leaden beats land heavier and bass churns harder. “With Heavy Age,” Ford says, “I wanted this to feel like an Unwed Sailor live record. Like if you came to an Unwed show, this is what you’d hear—heavy and bombastic, like grabbing someone by the shirt.” It’s an effect achieved in songs like “Thunderbird.” Here, Ford’s bass bristles beneath David Swatzell’s guitars, which burn and glimmer with the hot intensity of a sparkler, and Matt Putman’s plodding drums are bolstered by Colin Blanton’s second rhythmic layer. Likewise, on the title track, Swatzell’s guitars cut streaks across the song’s landscape, a menacing, overcast setting, stirred up by Ford’s murky bass, that match’s the album’s ponderous artwork.","country":"United States","track_count":31,"public_favorites_count":0,"followers_count":244,"followings_count":24,"plan":"Free","myspace_name":null,"discogs_name":null,"website_title":"US Booking","website":"http://www.greenbelttouring.com","reposts_count":0,"comments_count":1,"online":false,"likes_count":0,"playlist_count":7}
